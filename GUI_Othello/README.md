Originally this code was for an AI class assignment to study code AI using a min-max algorithm && depth-first search. This implementation is about me, gamerdude, studying Clanlib && using it to build a GUI. I hope gsparx doesn't mind too much ;)

The aim will be that this project will be compiled in VS Express 2010. I'm sorry, but that's what Clan lib uses in windows so that's what I'm using. Bleh.
